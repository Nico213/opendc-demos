    "### Horizontal Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [experiment 1](1.first_experiment.ipynb), we learned how to run OpenDC experiments and how to analyze and visualize the results to learn about the behavior of a data center. In this demo, we are using OpenDC to determine the impact of horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling refers to reducing (or increasing) the number of machines available in a data center to fit a workload better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although having a large number of machines can be beneficial for the performance of a data center,  having idle machines can result in a significant energy cost. On the other hand, having too few machines can significantly reduce the performance of the data center. In this demo, we are running the same workload (surf_week) on four different data center scales. Afterwards, we analyze the results to gain an understanding of the impact of data center size."
