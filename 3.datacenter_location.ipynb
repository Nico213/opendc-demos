    "In the [experiment 1](1.first_experiment.ipynb), we learned how to run OpenDC experiments and how to analyze and visualize the results to learn about the behavior of a data center. In this demo, we are using OpenDC to determine the impact of horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling refers to reducing (or increasing) the number of machines available in a data center to fit a workload better.\n",
